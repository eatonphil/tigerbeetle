# VOPR Hub Setup
* Follow these instructions to setup the VOPR Hub, along with several full-time VOPR simulators, on a dedicated testing machine.*
Install Go:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go
```

Add two users, namely `voprrunner` and `voprhub`. This creates *separation of concerns* between the two functions of the server.

The `voprrunner` will continuously run the VOPR and send any bugs to the VOPR Hub.

This will require setting passwords for the respective users:

```bash
sudo adduser voprhub
sudo adduser voprrunner
sudo usermod -aG sudo voprhub
sudo usermod -aG sudo voprrunner
```

## Set Up the VOPR Hub Component

Become the `voprhub` user:
```bash
su - voprhub
```

Clone `tigerbeetle`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coilhq/tigerbeetle.git
```

Install Zig:
```bash
cd ./tigerbeetle
./scripts/install_zig.sh
cd ../
```

Create a second `tigerbeetle` directory here inside the hub directory which will run the VOPR Hub. The initial `tigerbeetle` directory will be needed to replay any seeds that the hub receives.
```bash
mkdir hub
cp -r tigerbeetle hub/tigerbeetle
```

Create a `systemd` service unit file for the hub:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/voprhub.service
```
The file should contain the following (including an actual IP address and developer token with access to public repositories):
```bash
[Unit]

Description=Continously runs the VOPR Hub.

[Service]

User=voprhub
WorkingDirectory=/home/voprhub/hub/tigerbeetle/src/vopr_hub
Environment="REPOSITORY_URL=https://api.github.com/repos/coilhq/tigerbeetle/issues"
Environment="TIGERBEETLE_DIRECTORY=/home/voprhub/tigerbeetle"
Environment="VOPR_HUB_ADDRESS=<address>"
Environment="ISSUE_DIRECTORY=/home/voprhub"
Environment="DEVELOPER_TOKEN=******"
ExecStart=go run main.go
Restart=on-success

[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the VOPR Hub service:
```bash
systemctl start voprhub.service
# Check that we have liftoff.
systemctl status voprhub.service
# View logs e.g.
journalctl -f -n 100 -u voprhub.service
```

Go back to the `root` user:
```bash
exit
```

## Set Up the VOPR Component

Become the `voprrunner` user:
```bash
su - voprrunner
```

Create a script that will be used by the service to pull the latest code and run the VOPR:
```bash
sudo nano vopr_runner.sh
```

The file should contain the following (including an actual IP address):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

# Checkout the correct branch
export TIGERBEETLE_DIRECTORY="/home/voprrunner/tigerbeetle"
export REPOSITORY_URL="https://api.github.com/repos/coilhq/tigerbeetle/pulls"
export NUM_VOPRS="4"
export CURRENT_VOPR=$1
go run ./src/vopr_hub/vopr_organizer/main.go

# Fetch the latest code:
git pull

# Run the VOPR a few times before we go back to the top:
zig/zig run ./src/vopr.zig -- --send="<address>" --simulations=5
```

Create four `tigerbeetle` directories here.

Note that the number of directories corresponds to the number of service instances that will run.

Ideally, this number should be increased/decreased to be two less than the number of CPU cores available. The simulators burn CPU, and so this allocation leaves a core available for the rest of the system, plus a core for the hub itself.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coilhq/tigerbeetle.git
# Install Zig:
cd ./tigerbeetle
./scripts/install_zig.sh
cd ../
# Copy this directory to get four tigerbeetle directories.
cp -r tigerbeetle tigerbeetle1 # Repeat with incrementing values for the other instances. E.g. 2,3,4.
# Now we can remove the original directory.
rm -r tigerbeetle
```

Create a `systemd` service unit file.

Naming the file `vopr@.service` means that it acts as a template that can reuse the same file to run different services that each target their own directories.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vopr@.service
```

The file should contain the following:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Continously runs the VOPR.
PartOf=vopr.target

[Service]

User=voprrunner
WorkingDirectory=/home/voprrunner/tigerbeetle%i
ExecStart=/home/voprrunner/vopr_runner.sh %i
Restart=on-success

[Install]

WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create a target file to manage all instances, called `vopr.target`.

Dependencies must be listed under `Wants` instead of `Requires` because requiring the services will cause them all to restart whenever one terminates.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vopr.target
```

The file should contain the following:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Runs all VOPR services.
Wants=vopr@1.service vopr@2.service vopr@3.service vopr@4.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start all services:
```bash
systemctl start vopr.target
# Check it's VOPR'izing:
systemctl status vopr.target
# Check that the individual VOPR'raptors have started up:
systemctl status vopr@1.service
# View logs e.g.
journalctl -f -n 100 -u vopr@1.service
```
